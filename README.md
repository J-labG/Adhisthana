Adhisthana: Blessings For Disabled People

In the era of automation, where everyone finds their convenience from different technologies, we are here with an idea of AI-based home automation for Paraplegia (Paralysis of legs & Lower body) Patients. People suffering from Paraplegia cannot stand up on their own feet. Basic things like switching on lights & fans are difficult tasks for them.

So we, through our project, are trying to ease their routine through a machine learning-based method. 

Hands and their gestures are a very integral part of our body. We are fusing gestures with machine learning to automate home appliances. Cameras will detect the distinct gestures resulting in switching on/off various applications used in our day to day life. For instance, we can program the system in such a way that when a peace symbol is detected, the fan turns on and when the whole palm is detected the fan will be turned off.
